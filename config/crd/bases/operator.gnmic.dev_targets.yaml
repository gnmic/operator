              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

              A single Target may be collected by multiple Clusters (via different Pipelines),
              so the status is reported per-cluster.
